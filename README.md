## üß† Summary

As a seasoned Back-End Developer with over seven years of dedicated experience, I've had the pleasure of crafting robust and scalable web applications using C#, ASP.NET, and .NET Core. I'm a firm believer in building software that lasts, which is why I'm passionate about applying SOLID principles and Domain-Driven Design. I also enjoy architecting and developing microservices to create systems that are not only high-performing but also a breeze to maintain. My experience extends to fine-tuning backend performance for optimal speed and seamlessly integrating various third-party APIs. I truly thrive in collaborative environments, working closely with cross-functional teams to successfully deliver reliable and impactful software solutions.
